# probot-app-monorepo-sync

> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that keeps parent and child monorepos in sync

**NOTE**: The Github API has a limit of returning 100,000 tree items (i.e. files or folders), so this cannot support monorepos that exceed that amount of files and folders
