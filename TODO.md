- add hooks tests
- remove parent -> child CI status mirroring in exchange for single grouped status for each PR (since they will each have their own CI)

## try

- subtrees
  - try to bring over individual commits instead of squashing
    - if can't retain original commit author, at least include them in the commit message as co-author
  - try to use github api instead of local git
